# Hand-Coded Neural Network – MNIST Digit Recognition (Java)

A **fully hand-coded neural network implemented in Java**, trained on the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** to recognize digits **0–9**.  
The project includes an interactive **menu-driven interface** that allows users to explore, test, and interact with the neural network.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a neural network **from scratch**, without using machine learning libraries, to gain a deeper understanding of:

- Neural network architecture
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Model training and evaluation

The network is trained on the MNIST dataset and achieves digit classification through learned weight updates.

## Basic Features
- Custom-built neural network (no ML frameworks)
- Recognizes handwritten digits **0–9**
- Trained using the **MNIST dataset**
- Interactive menu system to:
  - Train the network
  - Load a pre-trained network
  - Test accuracy
  - Classify individual samples
  - View network information

## Neural Network Details
- Feedforward neural network architecture
- Backpropagation for learning
- Gradient descent optimization
